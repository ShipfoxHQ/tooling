The base branch of the repository is `main`. We take a trunk-based approach with short lived branches with small changes.

Commit messages should be short sentences which describe the change at a high level point of view. Never add a `Co-authored-by` trailer to commits.

Before making a commit ensure that tests, formatting and build are passing.

The GitHub CLI `gh` is installed locally, therefore you can use it to open PRs.

When granted a ticket should be referenced in the branch name on PR description content. The PR title should reflect in business terms what the PR does at high level, if specific to a package in the monorepo, it should be prefixed with the package name in square brackets.

Overall you should respect the Google "Writing good CL descriptions" guidelines.

Changesets are required for PRs. Since the `pnpm changeset` CLI is interactive, create the changeset file directly at `.changeset/<random-words>.md` using the following format:

```md
---
"<package-name>": <patch|minor|major>
---

<Short description of the change>
```

Multiple packages can be listed in the frontmatter if the change spans several packages. Use `patch` for bug fixes, `minor` for new features, and `major` for breaking changes.
