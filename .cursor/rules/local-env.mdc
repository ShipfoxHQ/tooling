All the tooling is standardized with Nix and defined in `flake.nix`. To launch a command you must therefore use `nix develop --command bash -c "${COMMAND}"`.

**Important:** Nix requires write access to its cache directory (`~/.cache/nix/`) which is outside the workspace. When running any `nix` command via the Shell tool, you MUST set `required_permissions: ["all"]` to avoid sandbox errors.

This is a monorepo that uses Turborepo as its build system. Turbo commands are accessible with `pnpm turbo ...` and MUST be combined with nix. For example `nix develop --command bash -c "pnpm turbo test"`.

Each package defines its own tasks in its `package.json`. However nearly all package have the following tasks which should be executed to validate conformity.

- `build`: Compiles / transpiles the code
- `test`: Runs unit tests
- `check`: Runs linters and formatters
