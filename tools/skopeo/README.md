# @shipfox/skopeo

Thin wrapper for common `skopeo` workflows, focused on copying/mirroring container images.

It should be used with other packages from [Shipfox](https://www.shipfox.io/).

- `skopeo-copy`: opinionated copy/mirror command for CI pipelines
- Simplifies auth/flags by using Shipfox conventions
