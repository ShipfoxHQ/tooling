# @shipfox/typescript

Thin wrappers around TypeScript tooling for consistent repo workflows.

It should be used with other packages from [Shipfox](https://www.shipfox.io/).

- `tsc-check`: type-check only (no emit)
- `tsc-emit`: emit JavaScript with path alias rewriting
- Designed to work with `@shipfox/ts-config`
