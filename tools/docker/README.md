# @shipfox/docker

Small utilities to build images and manage multi-arch manifests consistently in Shipfox repos.

It should be used with other packages from [Shipfox](https://www.shipfox.io/).

- `docker-build`: opinionated image builds (used locally and in CI)
- `docker-manifest`: create/push multi-arch manifests
- Works well with other @shipfox tooling
